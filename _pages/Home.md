### About me

I am a Research Scientist at Meta's Economics and Policy Research Team, where I lead economic impact measurement at scale, build production data systems, and conduct business model research for AI products. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at the [Golub Capital Social Impact Lab](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/labs-initiatives/sil) at Stanford GSB. I obtained my PhD in Economics from [Columbia University](https://econ.columbia.edu/) in May 2023.

My research focuses on causal inference, structural estimation, and econometric methods for analyzing data generated by AI and machine learning, using Bayesian inference and probabilistic programming. My work has applications to labor markets, health, and platform economics.
